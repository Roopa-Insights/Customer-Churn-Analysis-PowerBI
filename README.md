## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding why customers leave the bank and what factors drive churn. Using multiple Excel datasets merged and modelled in Power BI, the dashboard brings together customer demographics, account details, credit behaviour, and activity levels. The goal is to help the bank identify patterns behind customer exits and improve customer retention through data-driven decisions.

## Conclusion

The churn analysis shows that activity level, credit score, and product engagement play a crucial role in customer retention.
By focusing on low-credit-score customers, inactive members, and non-credit-card holders, the bank can reduce churn significantly.

This Power BI dashboard helps the business understand customer behaviour and supports better planning for retention campaigns.
